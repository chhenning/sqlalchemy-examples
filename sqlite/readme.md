## Foreign Keys

When relying on foreign keys make sure to emit the following statement:

`PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`

This is best done automatically when connecting to a database, via:

```py
from sqlalchemy import event
from sqlalchemy.engine import Engine

@event.listens_for(Engine, "connect")
def set_sqlite_pragma(dbapi_connection, connection_record):
    cursor = dbapi_connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON")
    cursor.close()
```

This might be even better since we are checking if a db connection is sqlite.

```py
from sqlalchemy import event
from sqlalchemy.engine import Engine
from sqlite3 import Connection as SQLite3Connection

@event.listens_for(Engine, "connect")
def _set_sqlite_pragma(dbapi_connection, connection_record):
    if isinstance(dbapi_connection, SQLite3Connection):
        cursor = dbapi_connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;")
        cursor.close()

```
